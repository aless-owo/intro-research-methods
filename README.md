# Adjective Analysis Between Writers

## Abstract
This research project aims to find out how the usage of adjectives by two socially critical authors differ from each other in character descriptions. I will be comparing novels from Mark Twain and Charles Dickens found in [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). I will be analyzing both adjective frequency and sentiment, to find out what sets these writers apart.

## Research question and hypothesis
### Research question
How does the use of adjectives compare between Mark Twain and Charles Dickens in their descriptions of characters? 
### Hypothesis
My hypothesis is that Dickens uses more adjectives per 1,000 words compared to Twain in character descriptions, while Twain’s descriptions of characters are generally more positive than Dickens’.

## Method
I will be using the Project Gutenberg dataset, in order to find books written b y Twain and Dickens. I will then analyze these books by counting the adjectives, and comparing the amount use between authors per 1000 words. I will then also be analyzing the sentiment of these adjectives using [a hugging face model interface)(https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) to see what author describes characters more positively.
