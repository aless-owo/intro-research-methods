# Adjective Analysis

## Abstract
This research project aims to find out how the usage of adjectives by two socially critical authors differ from each other in character descriptions. I will be comparing novels from Mark Twain and Charles Dickens. I will be analyzing both adjective frequency and sentiment, to find out what sets these writers apart.
